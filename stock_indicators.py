        The Williams %R is similar to an un-smoothed Stochastic %K. The values range from zero to 100, and are charted
        on an inverted scale, that is, with zero at the top and 100 at the bottom. Values below 20 indicate an
        overbought condition and a sell signal is generated when it crosses the 20 line. Values over 80 indicate an
        oversold condition and a buy signal is generated when it crosses the 80 line.

        range. During an uptrend, traders can watch for the indicator to move above 80. When the price starts moving
        up, and the indicator moves back below 80, it could signal that the uptrend in price is starting again.The
        same concept could be used to find short trades in a downtrend. When the indicator is below 20, watch for the
        price to start falling along with the Williams %R moving back above 20 to signal a potential continuation of
        the downtrend. Traders can also watch for momentum failures. During a strong uptrend, the price will often
        reach 20 or below. If the indicator falls, and then can't get back below 20 before falling again,
        that signals that the upward price momentum is in trouble and a bigger price decline could follow. The same

        been below 30. This means the divergence started from oversold territory and is more likely to result in an
        upside price reversal. 3, the Ultimate oscillator must rise above the divergence high. The divergence high is
        the high point between the two lows of the divergence. Williams created the same three-step method for sell
        signals. 1, a bearish divergence must form. This is when the price makes a higher high but the indicator is
        at a lower high. 2, the first high in the divergence (the higher one) must be above 70. This means the

        Bollinger Bands consist of three lines. The middle band is a simple moving average (generally 20 periods) of
        the typical price (TP). The upper and lower bands are F standard deviations (generally 2) above and below the
        middle band. The bands widen and narrow when the volatility of the price is higher or lower, respectively.

        Bollinger Bands do not, in themselves, generate buy or sell signals; they are an indicator of overbought or
        oversold conditions. When the price is near the upper or lower band it indicates that a reversal may be
        imminent. The middle band becomes a support or resistance level. The upper and lower bands can also be
        interpreted as price targets. When the price bounces off of the lower band and crosses the middle band,
        then the upper band becomes the price target.

        *The squeeze is the central concept of Bollinger Bands®. When the bands come close together, constricting the
        moving average, it is called a squeeze. A squeeze signals a period of low volatility and is considered by
        traders to be a potential sign of future increased volatility and possible trading opportunities. Conversely,
        the wider apart the bands move, the more likely the chance of a decrease in volatility and the greater the
        possibility of exiting a trade. However, these conditions are not trading signals. The bands give no
        indication when the change may take place or which direction price could move. Approximately 90% of price
        action occurs between the two bands. Any breakout above or below the bands is a major event. The breakout is
        not a trading signal. The mistake most people make is believing that that price hitting or exceeding one of
        the bands is a signal to buy or sell. Breakouts provide no clue as to the direction and extent of future

        The On Balance Volume (OBV) is a cumulative total of the up and down volume. When the close is higher than the

        the volume is subtracted from the running total.

        *The theory behind OBV is based on the distinction between smart money – namely, institutional investors –
        and less sophisticated retail investors. As mutual funds and pension funds begin to buy into an issue that
        retail investors are selling, volume may increase even as the price remains relatively level. Eventually,
        volume drives the price upward. At that point, larger investors begin to sell, and smaller investors begin
        buying. Despite being plotted on a price chart and measured numerically, the actual individual quantitative
        value of OBV is not relevant. The indicator itself is cumulative, while the time interval remains fixed by a
        dedicated starting point, meaning the real number value of OBV arbitrarily depends on the start date.
        Instead, traders and analysts look to the nature of OBV movements over time; the slope of the OBV line
        carries all of the weight of analysis. Analysts look to volume numbers on the OBV to track large,
        institutional investors. They treat divergences between volume and price as a synonym of the relationship
        between "smart money" and the disparate masses, hoping to showcase opportunities for buying against incorrect
        prevailing trends. For example, institutional money may drive up the price of an asset, then sell after other
        investors jump on the bandwagon. To interpret the OBV, look for the OBV to move with the price or precede
        price moves. If the price moves before the OBV, then it is a non-confirmed move. A series of rising peaks,
